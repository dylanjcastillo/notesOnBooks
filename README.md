# notesOnBooks
A few years ago, I noticed that my capacity of retaining important information from books I had read was quite poor. So I decided to start taking notes on the books' margins and a small notebook that I have for that purpose. Nevertheless, I was still not completely happy with the results. So I decided to create brief and structured notes instead, as a way to improve my note-taking method. 

I chose to upload my notes here for testing purposes as I'm currently working on an application that will allow people to create, share, and discuss their books notes.
