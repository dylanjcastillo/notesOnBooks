# Elevator pitch
The central message behind SITG is that if you have a share of the benefits, you should also have a share of the harm.

# Key takeaways:
SITG deals with 4 topics:
1. Uncertainty and reliability of knowledge -> In academia there's no difference between academia and the real world, in the real world there is
2. Symmetry in human affairs -> If you want to have the rewards, you also need to carry risks
3. Information sharing in transactions -> What is fair to share about the car when selling an used car?
4. Rationality in complex systems and in the real world -> What is rational? The purpose of religion & beliefs
