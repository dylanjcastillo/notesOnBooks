# Summary
Not having skin in the game, being separated from the consequences of your actions, do not allow you (or any system) to improve.

# Key takeaways
- You cannot separate knowledge from contact with ground (real world) -> e.g. Learn how to start a business by going to a Business School vs. trying yourself to start a business
- Interventionistas don't have skin in the game (there's no consequences when their actions fail), so they ask for the same failed procedure to be applied to solve a problem -> Why do we have so many intervention-driven politicians and very few bad plane pilots?
- Problems of interventionistas:
  1. *They think in low, not in high dimensions:* For multi-dimensional problems, there are not obvious one-dimensinal cause-and-effect mechanisms
  2. *They think in statics, not dynamics:* What happens when the "regime changes"?
  3. *They think in terms of actions, never interactions:* How do you forecast the effects of an action in a complex system? There are many interactions that you don't take in consideration
- Avoid engaging in an action with a big downside if one has no idea of the outcomes -> e.g. Would you take a bet where you barely have an idea of what you could win, but know for certain that you could end up broke/dead? 
- *Bob Rubin Trade:* Robert Rubin collected $120M in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the 2008 crash. He did that, by making a steady flow of money by using instruments that concealed explosive risks & after the event, saying that it was a Black Swan.
- *Rent-seeking:* Use protective regulations or "rights" to derive income without adding anything to economic activity.
- Systems learn via negativa (we know what it is wrong with more clarity than what is right) -> e.g. How many times have you touched a burning pan after you got burn the first time?

# Controversial
- The example about Price Andrew taking more risks than "commoners" during the Falkland war of 1982, might not be completely accurate. -> Was he really taking more risks (or even the same amount) as of other soliders?
