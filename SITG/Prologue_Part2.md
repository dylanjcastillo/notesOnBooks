# Summary
Skin in the game, allows for systems to improve, as it puts symmetry in the outcomes. Time, combined with SITG, makes systems evolve. A system where individuals don't have SITG cannot improve, as the bad actors are never removed.

# Key takeaways
- Hammurabi's best known injuction: "If a builder builds a house an the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house - the builder shall be put to death" -> Compare the quality of the houses architects build for others and their own
- *Golden Rule:* treat others the way you would like them to treat you
- *Silver Rule:* do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you 
- Silver Rule >> Golden Rule -> We know with more clarity what is bad than what is good
- Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice -> Would you take advice from a "life coach"?
- Revelations of preferences, focus on the actions not on the words. -> Otherwise, you'd become a fool or a charlatan (or both!) 
- It doesn't matter how frequently one is right, what matters is how much one makes when one is right. Being wrong when it is not costly, doesn't count
- Skin in the game, allows to ascertain than what has survived has revealed its robustness to Black Swan events
- *Lindy effect:*
  1. Time removes the fragile and keeps the robust
  2. The life expectancy of the non-fragile (e.g. beliefs, books) lengthens with time
- *Rational:* is what allows the collective to survive
- Replacing the natural, that is age-old, processes that have survived trillions of high-dimensional stressors with something in a "peer-reviewed" journal that may not survive replication or statistical scrutiny is neither science nor good practice -> Science vs. "Scientism"
- When you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication -> AI/Blockchain startups hype
- "With it or on it" What Spartan mothers would tell to their sons -> Either return with your shield or don't come back alive, only cowards throw their shields away to run faster
- The principal thing you learn from a professor is how to be a professor -> Most likely, we spend 4-6 years in life, learning how to be professors
