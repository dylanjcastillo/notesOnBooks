# Elevator pitch
We build models to predict the future and generate certainty. Nevertheless, models tend to fail and don't accomodate for many things of reality. So one has to be careful not to conflate the two.

# Key takeaways

- We build models to foretell the future, and (try to) control it
- In physics, it is easier to tell the crackpots from the expert, compared to finance -> Compare the capacity of prediction in the two fields
- After the financial crisis, two groups emerged: one where people wanted to purge all financial models, and another one with people who thought that models were just lacking, and that at some point in the future they will be able to forecast every nuance of the financial markets -> The truth is probably somewhere in between
- 3 ways of understanding the world:
  1. *Theories:* attemps to discover the principles that drive the world. They deal with the world on its own terms and must stand on their own feet
  2. *Models:* they are metaphors that compare the object of their attention to something else that it resembles
  3. *Intuition:* unifies the subject with the object -> Not really clear, I interpret it as knowing a subject so deeply that it becomes part of you
- We are constantly doing models of different areas of our lives, preconceptions are models
- Models are not reality, example of racial classification of people in South Africa
- You can count yourself lucky if your model of yourself survives it collision with time -> Rebels who defeat a dictator, to later become dictators themselves
- One has to treat people as responsible for their actions, and yet also recognize that they can't help what they do -> Your model of yourself vs. yourself
